### Created

Created a base install of create-react-app and a Node.js/Express project in a
subdirectory called /server. Added MongoDB support and created some test
routes and data to populate the front end-test content. Created a few test
components for the front-end to display test data.

Used Concurrently and proxy in the package.json to run both test servers
simultaneously and to route fetch requests to the back-end.
